To identify the reason for a pod restart in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the following command, assuming the project name is "internal" and the namespace is "production":

bash
Copy code
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n production
Here's the step-by-step process:

List the Pods in the Namespace: First, identify the name of the pod that has restarted.

bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods -n production
Describe the Pod: Once you have the pod name, use the kubectl describe pod command to get detailed information about the pod, including the reason for the restart.

bash
Copy code
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n production
Check Events Section: Look at the "Events" section in the output of the kubectl describe pod command. This section provides detailed information about the events that have occurred, including reasons for pod restarts.

Check Container Status: In the kubectl describe pod output, there is a section for each container in the pod that includes information about the container status. Look for Last State and State fields to see why the container restarted.

Alternatively, you can use the following command to get logs from the previous instance of the container (before it restarted):

bash
Copy code
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n production --previous
This command fetches the logs of the previous instance of the container, which might provide clues about why the container restarted.
